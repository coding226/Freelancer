I am sorry for not writting this change log before, but as did huge updates, want to let you know what's changed:

[11/11/2018]

- Changed layout of administration area abit
- Added SMTP mailing option to toplist. So in administration area you can choose how you want to send email, using PHP mail() or SMTP
- Vote banners, changed font, now current font supports russian, chinese, japanese server names

[11/08/2018]

- Servers Querying, now it's 100% perfect. Fetches servers by IP:port, hostname even by SRV hosts.
- For paypal set-up you just need paypal email - that's it! Way easier and does the same thing
- Recaptcha removed, now we use my custom coded anti-bots verification. Does the same thing, less struggle settings everything up, plus eats less resources,
doesn't required any additional libraries. Many advantages.
- Fixed some little styling issues. Was nothing serious, but still - my task is to provide high-end product.

- Coupons/discounts System
- Now you can give/remove/manage sponsored servers on admin panel (x1000 times requested feature, finally here)

- Fixed couple little bugs which been reported (0 known bugs known!)
- Now sponsored servers can upload custom icons to show instead of numeric rank!
