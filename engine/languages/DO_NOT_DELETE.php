<h2>What is '.SITE_name.'?</h2>
<p>'.SITE_name.' is a multiplayer server list for Hytale that ranks servers by user votes.</p>
<h2>How do I vote for a server?</h2>
<p>To vote for a server visit the server\'s page and click the green vote button. You will then be required to complete a Captcha for security reasons, and you can also enter your username to show up on the top voters list. You can vote for a maximum of one different server each day. </p>
<h2>What is Votifier?</h2>
<p>Votifier is a server plugin that allows server owners to know when you have voted for them. Server owners can enable Votifier when adding or editing a server. More information can be found on the <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/votifier/" target="_blank">official plugin page</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I add my server to the list?</h2>
<p>To add a server you must first create an account and verify your email address. Once you have done so log in, click the \'add a server\' button and enter the server details. You can only add a server if you are the owner or if you have been given permission by the owner.</p>
<h2>There is an error when adding my server.</h2>
<p>If your server is offline you won\'t be able to add it to the list until it comes back online. If the server is online, make sure you have entered the hostname and port correctly. If you are still having a problem adding your server please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. </p>
<h2>Why is the Players tab not showing on my server page?</h2>
<p>In order for '.SITE_name.' to display a full player list you must set enable-query to true in your server.properties file. The query.port should be set to the same port as that of your server. It may take a few minutes once this has been enabled for the tab to appear. </p>
<h2>Why has my server been deleted?</h2>
<p>'.SITE_name.' reserves the right to delete any server from the list with or without prior notice. A server may be removed for a number of reasons including (but not limited to) suspicious voting activity, inappropriate server details and low server uptime. Servers which have been listed for more than 10 days are automatically deleted if the uptime falls below 25%.</p>
<h2>Why has my banner been removed?</h2>
<p>Banners that are fast flashing or imitate site characteristics are not allowed and may be removed at the judgment of the '.SITE_name.' staff. </p>
<h2>Why have votes for my server disappeared?</h2>
<p>Votes are reset for all servers on the 1st of every month to provide fair competition for newer servers.</p>
<h2>What are sponsored servers?</h2>
<p>Sponsored servers are servers that have purchased a premium slot above the main list on the homepage. Sponsored server slots are auctioned off on a fortnightly basis and the 5 servers are ordered by the value of the bid. For more information please see the <a href="'.$txt['SITE_LINK'].'/sponsored">sponsored servers page</a>.</p>
<h2>My question has not been answered.</h2>
<p>Feel free to <a href="'.$txt['SITE_LINK'].'/contacts">contact us</a>.</p>';
